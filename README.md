I am a programmer with over 12 years of experience in various roles and various industries.

I empower teams by automating the delivery processes and establishing automated testing practices that ensure smooth, frequent and fast releases.
I implemented continuous delivery processes and tooling from scratch in fresh startups and migrated manual processes to automated continuous delivery in established organizations.

I have strong interest in developer tooling and I love to tinker with and improve the build and delivery processes and tools.

Having worked directly on the Gradle build tool, I am able to troubleshoot Gradle-specific build problems, improve and modernize existing builds, recommend or implement strategies for managing many and/or complex builds, or migrate builds from other build tools to Gradle.

My GitHub profile showcases some of my public work - plugins for developer tooling, my approach to testing and building web services as well as some more exotic tinkering, like a hand-crafted compiler for a subset of C.

If you think my skills and experience can help your project or business, please drop me a mail (firstname dot lastname at gmail), or reach out on LinkedIn.
